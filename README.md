# hello service

This service was part of a presentation I gave at the 2nd Dresden `Cloud Native & Kubernetes Meetup`. It is just a little hello world service, that greets
the consumer of the REST API with a friendly string. The point was to give a basic overview about the fundamental building blocks needed
to deploy applications to Kubernetes.

This project contains all source code needed to deploy this simple service to Kubernetes. It supports the deployment with helm in three stages.
